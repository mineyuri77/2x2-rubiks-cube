  Welcome to 2x2-algs!
  </h1>
  <h2>About</h2>
<p>This is website that I made because I think I have made a new algrothim set for 2x2.<br>
So I'll add new algrothim sets as I learn them some I don't know like the new algrothim set for 2x2.<br>
The agrothim set for 2x2 solves the top at the same time as inserting the last piece in a side.<br>
I will be adding content when I feel like to so that is what this website is about.<br>
If you have any questions contact: twobytwoalgswebsite@gmail.com
